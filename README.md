# Docker playground
Playground to learn docker related topics.

First example is mostly cloned from the great example at https://verbose-equals-true.gitlab.io/django-postgres-vue-gitlab-ecs/. This example covers the interaction of a couple containers including
django, vue, and nginx.

Second example is from https://www.learncloudnative.com/blog/2020-04-29-beginners-guide-to-docker/, which is 
a great overview of docker files from scratch.
