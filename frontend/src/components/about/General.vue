      About this project
    </h1>
    <p>This is an open-source project that demonstrates
      the use of several popular web technologies and focuses on
      <b>thorough explanations</b>, hence the name
      <tt>verbose equals true</tt>.</p>
    <p>I have been using this website to document and share my
      progress in three areas of software development: frontend
      engineering, backend engineering and DevOps. While there
       are numerous guides on the technologies I use here, there
       are fewer guides for how the technologies can by used
       <i>together</i>.</p>
    <p>For a visual overview of this project, see
      the architecture overview.</p>

    <p>Coming soon: continuous deployment with GitLab and docker!</p>
